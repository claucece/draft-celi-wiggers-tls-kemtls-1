# Introduction

DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft.

The primary goal of TLS 1.3 as defined in {{!RFC8446}} is to provide a
secure channel between two communicating peers; the only requirement
from the underlying transport is a reliable, in-order data stream.
Due to the advent of quantum computers, moving the TLS ecosystem
to post-quantum cryptography is a need. The protocol achieving that
goal is called KEMTLS. Specifically, this post-quantum secure channel
should provide the following properties:

-  Authentication: The server side of the channel is always
   authenticated; the client side is optionally authenticated.
   Authentication happens via asymmetric cryptography by the
   usage of key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEM) by using the long-term
   KEM public keys in the Certificate.

-  Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel after establishment is
   only visible to the intended endpoints.  KEMTLS does not hide the
   length of the data it transmits, though endpoints are able to pad
   KEMTLS records in order to obscure lengths and improve protection
   against traffic analysis techniques.

-  Integrity: Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot
   be modified by attackers without detection.

KEMTLS is provided as an extension to TLS 1.3, but it heavily modifies
the handshake protocol of it.

In this document, we will describe two modes in which KEMTLS can be used:
a full post-quantum mode where only post-quantum algorithms are used
and a hybrid post-quantum mode where traditional and post-quantum
algorithms are combined.

Note that KEMTLS can also be used in any of those modes with cached
information to reduce the number of round trips it needs to perform.

# Protocol Overview

Figure 1 below shows the basic full KEMTLS handshake with both KEMTLS
modes:

             Figure 1: Message Flow for Full KEMTLS Handshake
             Post-quantum KEMs that can be added are shown as part of the
             key_share and signature_algorithms extensions
~~~~~

The handshake can be thought of in four phases compared to the
three ones from TLS 1.3. It achieves both post-quantum confidentiality and
post-quantum authentication (certificate-based).

In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello
message, which contains a random nonce (ClientHello.random); its
offered protocol versions; a list of symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs; a set
of KEM key shares and/or hybrid key shares (if using a hybrid mode); and
potentially additional extensions.

The server processes the ClientHello, and determines the appropriate
cryptographic parameters for the connection: if both a Post-quantum
KEM has been advertised for usage in key_shares and signature_algorithms
extension, then KEMTLS is supported by the client.

The server then responds with its own ServerHello, which indicates the
negotiated connection parameters.
The combination of the ClientHello and the ServerHello determines the shared
keys.  The ServerHello contains a "key_share" extension with the server's
ephemeral Post-Quantum KEM share; the server's share MUST be in the same group
as one of the client's shares.  If a hybrid mode is in use, the ServerHello
contains a "key_share" extension with the server's ephemeral hybrid
share, which MUST be in the same group as the client's shares, and the
post-quantum one.

The server then sends two messages to establish the Server
Parameters:

* EncryptedExtensions:  responses to ClientHello extensions that are
  not required to determine the cryptographic parameters, other than
  those that are specific to individual certificates.

* CertificateRequest:  in KEMTLS, only certificate-based client
  authentication is desired, so the server sends the desired parameters
  for that certificate.  This message is omitted if client authentication
  is not desired.

Then, the client and server exchange implicity authenticated messages.
KEMTLS uses the same set of messages every time that certificate-based
authentication is needed.  Specifically:

* Certificate:  The certificate of the endpoint and any per-certificate
  extensions.  This message is omitted by the client if the server
  did not send CertificateRequest (thus indicating that the client
  should not authenticate with a certificate). The Certificate
  should include a long-term public KEM key. If a hybrid mode is in
  use, the Certificate should also include a hybrid long-term public
  key.

* KEMCiphertext: A key encapsulation against the certificate's long-term
  public key, which yields an implicitly authenticated shared secret.

Upon receiving the server's messages, the client responds with its
Authentication messages, namely Certificate and KEMCiphertext (if
requested).

Finally, the server and client reply with their explicitly authenticated
messages, specifically:

* Finished:  A MAC (Message Authentication Code) over the entire
  handshake.  This message provides key confirmation and binds the
  endpoint's identity to the exchanged keys.

At this point, the handshake is complete, and the client and server
derive the keying material required by the record layer to exchange
application-layer data protected through authenticated encryption.

Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished
message, except as specified in Section 2.3.  Note that while the
client may send Application Data prior to receiving the server's
last Authentication message, any data sent at that point is, of course,
being sent to an implicitly authenticated peer. It is worth noting
that Application Data sent prior to receiving the server's last
Authentication message can be subject to a client downgrade
attack. Full downgrade resilience is only achieved when explicit
authentication is achieved: when the Client receives the Finished
message from the Server.

## Prior-knowledge KEM-TLS

Given the added number of round-trips of KEMTLS compared to the TLS 1.3,
the KEMTLS handshake can be improved by the usage of pre-distributed
KEM authentication keys to achieve explicit authentication and full downgrade
resilience as early as possible. A peer's long-term KEM authentication key can
be cached in advance, as well.

Figure 2 below shows a pair of handshakes in which the first handshake
establishes cached information and the second handshake uses it:

       [Application Data]           <------->  [Application Data]
~~~~~

In some applications, such as in a VPN, the client already knows that the
server will require mutual authentication. This means that a client can proactively
authenticate by sending its certificate as early in the handshake as possible.
The client's certificate have to be sent encrypted by using the shared secret
derived from the kem_ciphertext encapsulation.

# Handshake protocol

The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters
of a connection, as in TLS 1.3. It uses the same messages, expect
for the addition of a `KEMCiphertext` message and does not use
the `CertificateVerify` one.

~~~
enum {
          ...
          encrypted_extensions(8),
          certificate(11),
          kem_ciphertext(tbd),
          certificate_request(13),
          ...
          message_hash(254),
          (255)
      } HandshakeType;

      struct {
          HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
          uint24 length;             /* remaining bytes in message */
          select (Handshake.msg_type) {
              ...
              case encrypted_extensions:  EncryptedExtensions;
              case certificate_request:   CertificateRequest;
              case certificate:           Certificate;
              case kem_ciphertext:        KEMCiphertext;
              ...
          };
      } Handshake;
~~~

Protocol messages MUST be sent in the order defined in Section 4.
A peer which receives a handshake message in an unexpected order MUST
abort the handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert.

## Key Exchange Messages

KEMTLS uses the same key exchange messages as TLS 1.3 with this
exceptions:

- Usage of a new message `KEMCiphertext`.
- The `CertificateVerify` message is not used.
- Two extensions can be added to the `ClientHello` message: "cached_information"
  and "kem_ciphertext".
- One extensions can be added to the `ServerHello` message: "cached_information".

KEMTLS preserves the same cryptographic negotiation with the addition
of more algorithms to the "supported_groups" and "signature_algorithms".

### Client Hello

KEMTLS uses the `ClientHello` message as described for TLS 1.3. When used
in a pre-distributed mode, however, two extensions are mandatory: "cached_information"
and `kem_ciphertext` for server authentication. This extensions are
described later in the document.

### Server Hello

KEMTLS uses the `ServerHello` message as described for TLS 1.3. When used
in a pre-distributed mode, however, one extensions is mandatory: "cached_information"
for server authentication. This extension is described later in the document.

### Hello Retry Request

KEMTLS uses the `ServerHello` message as described for TLS 1.3. When used
in a pre-distributed mode, however, a Hello Retry Request message
should not be sent.

### Extensions

A number of KEMTLS messages contain tag-length-value encoded extensions
structures. We are adding those extensions to the `ExtensionType` list
from TLS 1.3.

~~~
enum {
    ...
    signature_algorithms_cert(50),              /* RFC 8446 */
    key_share(51),                              /* RFC 8446 */
    kem_ciphertext(TBD),                        /* RFC TBD */
    cached_info(TBD),                           /* RFC TBD */
    (65535)
} ExtensionType;
~~~

The table below indicates the messages where a given extension may
appear:

~~~
   +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | Extension                                        |     TLS 1.3 |
   +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+
   | cached_info [RFCTBD]                             |      CH, SH |
   |                                                  |             |
   | kem_ciphertext [RFCTBD]                          |          CH |
   |                                                  |             |
   +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+
~~~

### Signature Algorithms

This extension works the same was as with TLS 1.3; but certain algorithms
are added to the `SignatureScheme` list:

~~~
  enum {
      ...
      /* EdDSA algorithms */
      ed25519(0x0807),
      ed448(0x0808),

      /* RSASSA-PSS algorithms with public key OID RSASSA-PSS */
      rsa_pss_pss_sha256(0x0809),

      kyber512_secp521r1(TBD),
      ntru2048509_secp521r1(TBD),

      kyber512_ed448(TBD),
      ntru2048509_ed448(TBD),
      light_saber_ed448(TBD),

      /* Legacy algorithms */
      rsa_pkcs1_sha1(0x0201),
      ecdsa_sha1(0x0203),

      /* Reserved Code Points */
      private_use(0xFE00..0xFFFF),
      (0xFFFF)
  } SignatureScheme;
~~~

The algorithms added here correspond to the round-3 finalists of the post-quantum
NIST competition targeting a 128 security level.

####  Supported Groups

This extension works the same was as with TLS 1.3; but certain algorithms
are added to the `NamedGroup` list:

~~~
  enum {

      /* Elliptic Curve Groups (ECDHE) */
      secp256r1(0x0017), secp384r1(0x0018), secp521r1(0x0019),
      x25519(0x001D), x448(0x001E),

      ffdhe6144(0x0103), ffdhe8192(0x0104),

      /* Post-Quantum KEMs (PQKEM) */
      Kyber512(TBD), ntru2048509(TBD), light_saber(TBD)

      /* Hybrid KEMs (HKEM) */
      kyber512_secp256r1(TBD), ntru2048509_secp256r1(TBD),
      light_saber_secp256r1(TBD),

      light_saber_ed448(TBD),

      /* Reserved Code Points */
      ecdhe_private_use(0xFE01..0xFEFF),
      (0xFFFF)
  } NamedGroup;
~~~

The algorithms added here correspond to the round-3 finalists of the post-quantum
NIST competition targeting a 128 security level.

#### Cached Information

This document defines a new extension type (cached_info(TBD)), which
is used in ClientHello and ServerHello messages.  The extension type
is specified as follows.

~~~
  enum {
       cached_info(TBD), (65535)
  } ExtensionType;
~~~

The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
ClientHello, MUST contain the `CachedInformation` structure.  The
client MAY send multiple CachedObjects of the same `CachedInformationType`.
This may, for example, be the case when the client has cached multiple
certificates from the server.

~~~
  enum {
       cert(1) (255)
  } CachedInformationType;

  struct {
       select (type) {
         case client:
           CachedInformationType type;
           opaque hash_value<1..255>;
         case server:
           CachedInformationType type;
       } body;
  } CachedObject;

  struct {
       CachedObject cached_info<1..2^16-1>;
  } CachedInformation;
~~~

This document defines the following type:

- 'cert' type for not sending the complete server certificate message:
   With the type field set to 'cert', the client MUST include the
   fingerprint of the Certificate message in the hash_value field.
   For this type, the fingerprint MUST be calculated using the
   procedure below, using the Certificate message as the input data.

The fingerprint calculation proceeds this way:

1.  Compute the SHA-256 hash of the input data. Note that the computed
    hash only covers the input data structure (and not any type and
    length information of the record layer).
2.  Use the output of the SHA-256 hash.

The purpose of the fingerprint provided by the client is to help the
server select the correct information.  The fingerprint identifies the server
certificate (and the corresponding private key) for use with the rest
of the handshake.

If this extension is not present, the `kem_ciphertext` extension MUST
not be present as well. If present, it will be ignored.

# Key schedule

## Negotiation

1. Add KEMs to ``supported_groups`` and KEM public key to ``key_shares``.
1. Add ``KEMTLSwithSomeKEM`` to ``signature_algorithms``.
  1. Alternatively, use DC draft and add it to ``signature_algorithms_dc``.
1. Server replies with KEM ciphertext encapsulated to KEM public key (or HRR).
1. Server replies with CA-signed KEM public-key X.509 certificate.
  1. Alternatively, use DC draft and reply with KEM delegated credential.
1. Server MUST NOT submit ``CertificateVerify`` message.
1. Client detects that KEMTLS is being used via the "signature algorithm", ie. the type of credential provided by the server.
1. Client encapsulates ciphertext to server and transmits it as ``ClientKEMCiphertext`` (or piggy-back on ``ClientKeyExchange``?).
1. Client submits ``ClientFinished``.
1. Client completed handshake.
1. Server submits ``ServerFinished``.
1. Server completes handshake.


TODO probably split off DC into separate paragraph.

## Handshake Secret

The Handshake secret ``HS`` is derived from the ephemeral key exchange
shared secret.

    ...
                         v
    ephemeral_kem_shared -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret
                         v
    ...

## Authenticated Handshake Secret

After deriving ``HS``, the Handshake Secret, from the ephemeral keys, we
need an additional handshake secret in KEMTLS.
We require this additional handshake secret as we need an (implicitly)
authenticated handshake secret to encrypt any client credentials under.
Otherwise we do not have confidentiality for the client certificate.

``AHS`` is derived from the hanshake secret and the static shared key.
We change the derivation of the main secret accordingly.

                      Handshake Secret
                         |
                         v
                        Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
                         |
                         v
    static_server_shared -> HKDF.Extract = Authenticated Handshake Secret
                         |
                         +-----> Derive-Secret(., "c ahs traffic",
                         |                     ClientHello...ClientKemCiphertext)
                         |                     = client_authenticated_handshake_traffic_secret
                         |
                         +-----> Derive-Secret(., "s ahs traffic",
                         |                     ClientHello...ClientKemCiphertext)
                         |                     = server_authenticated_handshake_traffic_secret
                         |
                         v
                        Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
                         |
                         v
    static_client_shared -> HKDF.Extract = Main Secret
                         v


``shared_secret_static_client_kem`` is the shared secret encapsulated to the client's public key.
If there is no client authentication, it's simply replaced by ``0``.

                         v
                       0 -> HKDF.Extract = Main Secret
                         v

## Finished keys

We derived the finished keys from ``MS`` instead of from ``CHTS`` and ``SHTS``.
We separate them by individual labels and the transcript.

    finished_client <- HKDF.Expand(MS, "c finished", transcript_up_to_CF)
    finished_server <- HKDF.Expand(MS, "s finished", transcript_up_to_SF)


# Protocol Mechanics

TODO

# (Middlebox) Compatibility Considerations

Like in TLS 1.3, after the ephemeral key is derived
a ``ChangeCipherSpec`` message is sent and the messages afterwards are
encrypted. This will make the following messages opaque to non-decrypting
middle boxes.

The ``ClientHello`` and ``ServerHello`` messages are still in the clear
and these require the addition of new ``key_share`` types.
Typical KEM public-key and ciphertext sizes are also significantly bigger
than pre-quantum (EC)DH keyshares. This may still cause problems.

# Integration with Delegated Credentials

# Security Considerations {#sec-considerations}

TODO:

* sending data to an implicitly authenticated and not-full downgrade
resilient peer
* address CA and pq keys
* consider implicit vs explicit authentication
* consider downgrade resilience

# IANA Considerations

* We need a new OID for each KEM to encode them in X.509 certificates.
