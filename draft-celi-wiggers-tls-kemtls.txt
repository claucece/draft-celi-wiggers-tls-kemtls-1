1.  Introduction

   DISCLAIMER: This is a work-in-progress draft.

   The primary goal of TLS 1.3 as defined in [RFC8446] is to provide a
   secure channel between two communicating peers; the only requirement
   from the underlying transport is a reliable, in-order data stream.
   Due to the advent of quantum computers, moving the TLS ecosystem to
   post-quantum cryptography is a need.  The protocol achieving that
   goal is called KEMTLS.  Specifically, this post-quantum secure
   channel should provide the following properties:

   *  Authentication: The server side of the channel is always
      authenticated; the client side is optionally authenticated.
      Authentication happens via asymmetric cryptography by the usage of
      key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEM) by using the long-term KEM
      public keys in the Certificate.

   *  Confidentiality: Data sent over the channel after establishment is
      only visible to the intended endpoints.  KEMTLS does not hide the
      length of the data it transmits, though endpoints are able to pad
      KEMTLS records in order to obscure lengths and improve protection
      against traffic analysis techniques.

   *  Integrity: Data sent over the channel after establishment cannot
      be modified by attackers without detection.

   KEMTLS is provided as an extension to TLS 1.3, but it heavily
   modifies the handshake protocol of it.

   In this document, we will describe two modes in which KEMTLS can be
   used: a full post-quantum mode where only post-quantum algorithms are
   used and a hybrid post-quantum mode where traditional and post-
   quantum algorithms are combined.

   Note that KEMTLS can also be used in any of those modes with cached
   information to reduce the number of round trips it needs to perform.

2.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in

4.  Protocol Overview

   Figure 1 below shows the basic full KEMTLS handshake with both KEMTLS
   modes:

             Figure 1: Message Flow for Full KEMTLS Handshake
             Post-quantum KEMs that can be added are shown as part of the
             key_share and signature_algorithms extensions

   The handshake can be thought of in four phases compared to the three
   ones from TLS 1.3.  It achieves both post-quantum confidentiality and
   post-quantum authentication (certificate-based).

   In the Key Exchange phase, the client sends the ClientHello message,
   which contains a random nonce (ClientHello.random); its offered
   protocol versions; a list of symmetric cipher/HKDF hash pairs; a set
   of KEM key shares and/or hybrid key shares (if using a hybrid mode);
   and potentially additional extensions.

   The server processes the ClientHello, and determines the appropriate
   cryptographic parameters for the connection: if both a Post-quantum
   KEM has been advertised for usage in key_shares and
   signature_algorithms extension, then KEMTLS is supported by the
   client.

   The server then responds with its own ServerHello, which indicates
   the negotiated connection parameters.  The combination of the
   ClientHello and the ServerHello determines the shared keys.  The
   ServerHello contains a "key_share" extension with the server's
   ephemeral Post-Quantum KEM share; the server's share MUST be in the
   same group as one of the client's shares.  If a hybrid mode is in
   use, the ServerHello contains a "key_share" extension with the
   server's ephemeral hybrid share, which MUST be in the same group as
   the client's shares, and the post-quantum one.

   The server then sends two messages to establish the Server
   Parameters:

   *  EncryptedExtensions: responses to ClientHello extensions that are
      not required to determine the cryptographic parameters, other than
      those that are specific to individual certificates.

   *  CertificateRequest: in KEMTLS, only certificate-based client
      authentication is desired, so the server sends the desired
      parameters for that certificate.  This message is omitted if
      client authentication is not desired.

   Then, the client and server exchange implicity authenticated
   messages.  KEMTLS uses the same set of messages every time that
   certificate-based authentication is needed.  Specifically:

   *  Certificate: The certificate of the endpoint and any per-
      certificate extensions.  This message is omitted by the client if
      the server did not send CertificateRequest (thus indicating that
      the client should not authenticate with a certificate).  The
      Certificate should include a long-term public KEM key.  If a
      hybrid mode is in use, the Certificate should also include a
      hybrid long-term public key.

   *  KEMCiphertext: A key encapsulation against the certificate's long-
      term public key, which yields an implicitly authenticated shared
      secret.

   Upon receiving the server's messages, the client responds with its
   Authentication messages, namely Certificate and KEMCiphertext (if
   requested).

   Finally, the server and client reply with their explicitly
   authenticated messages, specifically:

   *  Finished: A MAC (Message Authentication Code) over the entire
      handshake.  This message provides key confirmation and binds the
      endpoint's identity to the exchanged keys.

   At this point, the handshake is complete, and the client and server
   derive the keying material required by the record layer to exchange
   application-layer data protected through authenticated encryption.

   Application Data MUST NOT be sent prior to sending the Finished
   message, except as specified in Section 2.3.  Note that while the
   client may send Application Data prior to receiving the server's last
   Authentication message, any data sent at that point is, of course,
   being sent to an implicitly authenticated peer.  It is worth noting
   that Application Data sent prior to receiving the server's last
   Authentication message can be subject to a client downgrade attack.
   Full downgrade resilience is only achieved when explicit
   authentication is achieved: when the Client receives the Finished
   message from the Server.

4.1.  Prior-knowledge KEM-TLS

   Given the added number of round-trips of KEMTLS compared to the TLS
   1.3, the KEMTLS handshake can be improved by the usage of pre-
   distributed KEM authentication keys to achieve explicit
   authentication and full downgrade resilience as early as possible.  A
   peer's long-term KEM authentication key can be cached in advance, as
   well.

   Figure 2 below shows a pair of handshakes in which the first
   handshake establishes cached information and the second handshake
   uses it:

       [Application Data]           <------->  [Application Data]

   In some applications, such as in a VPN, the client already knows that
   the server will require mutual authentication.  This means that a
   client can proactively authenticate by sending its certificate as
   early in the handshake as possible.  The client's certificate have to
   be sent encrypted by using the shared secret derived from the
   kem_ciphertext encapsulation.

5.  Handshake protocol

   The handshake protocol is used to negotiate the security parameters
   of a connection, as in TLS 1.3.  It uses the same messages, expect
   for the addition of a "KEMCiphertext" message and does not use the
   "CertificateVerify" one.

   enum {
             ...
             encrypted_extensions(8),
             certificate(11),
             kem_ciphertext(tbd),
             certificate_request(13),
             ...
             message_hash(254),
             (255)
         } HandshakeType;

         struct {
             HandshakeType msg_type;    /* handshake type */
             uint24 length;             /* remaining bytes in message */
             select (Handshake.msg_type) {
                 ...
                 case encrypted_extensions:  EncryptedExtensions;
                 case certificate_request:   CertificateRequest;
                 case certificate:           Certificate;
                 case kem_ciphertext:        KEMCiphertext;
                 ...
             };
         } Handshake;

   Protocol messages MUST be sent in the order defined in Section 4.  A
   peer which receives a handshake message in an unexpected order MUST
   abort the handshake with an "unexpected_message" alert.

5.1.  Key Exchange Messages

   KEMTLS uses the same key exchange messages as TLS 1.3 with this
   exceptions:

   *  Usage of a new message "KEMCiphertext".

   *  The "CertificateVerify" message is not used.

   *  Two extensions can be added to the "ClientHello" message:
      "cached_information" and "kem_ciphertext".

   *  One extensions can be added to the "ServerHello" message:
      "cached_information".

   KEMTLS preserves the same cryptographic negotiation with the addition
   of more algorithms to the "supported_groups" and
   "signature_algorithms".

5.1.1.  Client Hello

   KEMTLS uses the "ClientHello" message as described for TLS 1.3.  When
   used in a pre-distributed mode, however, two extensions are
   mandatory: "cached_information" and "kem_ciphertext" for server
   authentication.  This extensions are described later in the document.

5.1.2.  Server Hello

   KEMTLS uses the "ServerHello" message as described for TLS 1.3.  When
   used in a pre-distributed mode, however, one extensions is mandatory:
   "cached_information" for server authentication.  This extension is
   described later in the document.

5.1.3.  Hello Retry Request

   KEMTLS uses the "ServerHello" message as described for TLS 1.3.  When
   used in a pre-distributed mode, however, a Hello Retry Request
   message should not be sent.

5.1.4.  Extensions

   A number of KEMTLS messages contain tag-length-value encoded
   extensions structures.  We are adding those extensions to the
   "ExtensionType" list from TLS 1.3.

   enum {
       ...
       signature_algorithms_cert(50),              /* RFC 8446 */
       key_share(51),                              /* RFC 8446 */
       kem_ciphertext(TBD),                        /* RFC TBD */
       cached_info(TBD),                           /* RFC TBD */
       (65535)
   } ExtensionType;

   The table below indicates the messages where a given extension may
   appear:

      +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+
      | Extension                                        |     TLS 1.3 |
      +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+
      | cached_info [RFCTBD]                             |      CH, SH |

      | kem_ciphertext [RFCTBD]                          |          CH |
      |                                                  |             |
      +--------------------------------------------------+-------------+

5.1.4.1.  Signature Algorithms

   This extension works the same was as with TLS 1.3; but certain
   algorithms are added to the "SignatureScheme" list:

     enum {
         ...
         /* EdDSA algorithms */
         ed25519(0x0807),
         ed448(0x0808),

         (0xFFFF)
     } SignatureScheme;

   The algorithms added here correspond to the round-3 finalists of the
   post-quantum NIST competition targeting a 128 security level.

5.1.4.2.  Supported Groups

   This extension works the same was as with TLS 1.3; but certain
   algorithms are added to the "NamedGroup" list:

     enum {

         /* Elliptic Curve Groups (ECDHE) */
         secp256r1(0x0017), secp384r1(0x0018), secp521r1(0x0019),
         x25519(0x001D), x448(0x001E),

         /* Finite Field Groups (DHE) */
         ffdhe2048(0x0100), ffdhe3072(0x0101), ffdhe4096(0x0102),
         ffdhe6144(0x0103), ffdhe8192(0x0104),

         /* Post-Quantum KEMs (PQKEM) */
         Kyber512(TBD), ntru2048509(TBD), light_saber(TBD)

         /* Hybrid KEMs (HKEM) */
         kyber512_secp256r1(TBD), ntru2048509_secp256r1(TBD),
         light_saber_secp256r1(TBD),

         kyber512_secp384r1(TBD), ntru2048509_secp384r1(TBD),
         light_saber_secp384r1(TBD),

         kyber512_secp521r1(TBD), ntru2048509_secp521r1(TBD),
         light_saber_secp521r1(TBD),

         kyber512_x25519(TBD), ntru2048509_x25519(TBD),
         light_saber_ed25519(TBD),

         kyber512_x448(TBD), ntru2048509_ed448(TBD),
         light_saber_ed448(TBD),

         /* Reserved Code Points */
         ecdhe_private_use(0xFE01..0xFEFF),
         (0xFFFF)
     } NamedGroup;

   The algorithms added here correspond to the round-3 finalists of the
   post-quantum NIST competition targeting a 128 security level.

5.1.4.3.  Key Share

   KEMTLS uses the same mechanism as TLS 1.3 for advertising the
   endpoint's cryptographic parameters, with these changes:

     struct {
         NamedGroup group;
         HybridKeyExchange hybrid_key_exchanges;
     } KeyShareEntry;

   The HybridKeyExchange sent as part of the ClientHello or
   HelloRetryMessage corresponds to:

   struct {
       opaque key_exchange_1<1..2^16-1>; ----> the classical public key
       opaque key_exchange_2<1..2^16-1>; ----> the post-quantum public key
   } HybridKeyExchange

   The HybridKeyExchange sent as part of the ServerHello:

    struct {
        opaque key_exchange_1<1..2^16-1>; ----> the classical public key
        opaque key_exchange_2<1..2^16-1>; ----> the KEM ciphertext
    } HybridKeyExchange

   If a hybrid mode is not in use, only the post-quantum public key or
   ciphertext is advertised.

5.1.4.4.  Cached Information

   This document defines a new extension type (cached_info(TBD)), which
   is used in ClientHello and ServerHello messages.  The extension type
   is specified as follows.

     enum {
          cached_info(TBD), (65535)
     } ExtensionType;

   The extension_data field of this extension, when included in the
   ClientHello, MUST contain the "CachedInformation" structure.  The
   client MAY send multiple CachedObjects of the same
   "CachedInformationType".  This may, for example, be the case when the
   client has cached multiple certificates from the server.

     enum {
          cert(1) (255)
     } CachedInformationType;

     struct {
          select (type) {
            case client:
              CachedInformationType type;
              opaque hash_value<1..255>;
            case server:
              CachedInformationType type;
          } body;
     } CachedObject;

     struct {
          CachedObject cached_info<1..2^16-1>;
     } CachedInformation;

   This document defines the following type:

   *  'cert' type for not sending the complete server certificate
      message: With the type field set to 'cert', the client MUST
      include the fingerprint of the Certificate message in the
      hash_value field.  For this type, the fingerprint MUST be
      calculated using the procedure below, using the Certificate
      message as the input data.

   The fingerprint calculation proceeds this way:

   1.  Compute the SHA-256 hash of the input data.  Note that the
       computed hash only covers the input data structure (and not any
       type and length information of the record layer).

   2.  Use the output of the SHA-256 hash.

   The purpose of the fingerprint provided by the client is to help the
   server select the correct information.  The fingerprint identifies
   the server certificate (and the corresponding private key) for use
   with the rest of the handshake.

   If this extension is not present, the "kem_ciphertext" extension MUST
   not be present as well.  If present, it will be ignored.

5.1.5.  Implicit Authentication Messages

   As discussed, KEMTLS generally uses a common set of messages for
   implicit authentication and key confirmation: Certificate and
   KEMCiphertext.

   The computations for the Authentication messages all uniformly take
   the following inputs:

   *  The certificate and authentication key to be used.

   *  A Handshake Context consisting of the set of messages to be
      included in the transcript hash.

   *  A Shared Secret Key (from the PQ KEM operations) to be used to
      compute an authenticated handshake shared key.

   *  A Handshake Context consisting of the set of messages to be
      included in the transcript hash.

   Based on these inputs, the messages then contain:

   Certificate: The certificate to be used for authentication, and any
   supporting certificates in the chain.

   KEMCiphertext: The post-quantum KEM ciphertext (or a hybrid one)
   against the certificate's public key(s).

   KEMTLS follows the TLS 1.3 key schedule, which applies a sequence of
   HKDF operations to the Shared Secret Key and the handshake context to
   derive:

   *  the client and server handshake traffic secrets "CHTS" and "SHTS"
      which are used to encrypt subsequent flows in the handshake

   *  "derived handshake secret" "dHS" which is kept as the current
      secret state of the key schedule

5.1.6.  Certificate

   KEMTLS uses the same Certificate message as TLS 1.3 with these
   changes:

  enum {
      X509(0),
      RawHybridPublicKey(2),
      (255)
  } CertificateType;

  struct {
      select (certificate_type) {
          case RawHybridPublicKey:
            /* From RFC TBD */
            opaque ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>; ----> the classical KEM public key
            opaque ASN1_subjectPublicKeyInfo<1..2^24-1>; ----> the post-quantum KEM public key

          case X509:
            opaque cert_data<1..2^24-1>;
      };
      Extension extensions<0..2^16-1>;
  } CertificateEntry;

  struct {
      opaque certificate_request_context<0..2^8-1>;
      CertificateEntry certificate_list<0..2^24-1>;
  } Certificate;

   In a hybrid mode, the leaf Certificate or the RawHybridPublicKey MUST
   contain both a classical KEM public key and a post-quantum one.  In a
   non-hybrid mode, the leaf Certificate or the RawHybridPublicKey MUST
   contain a post-quantum KEM public key.

5.1.7.  KEM Ciphertext

   This message is used to provide implicit proof that an endpoint
   possesses the private key(s) corresponding to its certificate by
   sending the appropriate parameters that will be used to calculate the
   shared secret.

   The calculation of the shared secret also provides integrity for the
   handshake up to this point.  Servers MUST send this message when
   authenticating via a certificate.  Clients MUST send this message
   whenever authenticating via a certificate (i.e., when the Certificate
   message is non-empty).  When sent, this message MUST appear
   immediately after the Certificate message and immediately prior to
   the Finished message.

   Structure of this message:

     struct {
         SignatureScheme algorithm;
         opaque ciphertext<0..2^16-1>;
     } KEMCiphertext;

   The algorithm field specifies the authentication algorithm used.  The
   ciphertext is the result of a Encapsulation() function.  In the
   hybrid mode, it is a concatenation of the two return of
   Encapsulation() functions.

   If the KEMCiphertext message is sent by a server, the authentication
   algorithm MUST be one offered in the client's "signature_algorithms"
   extension unless no valid certificate chain can be produced without
   unsupported algorithms.

   If sent by a client, the authentication algorithm used in the
   signature MUST be one of those present in the
   supported_signature_algorithms field of the "signature_algorithms"
   extension in the CertificateRequest message.

   In addition, the authentication algorithm MUST be compatible with the
   key in the sender's end-entity certificate.

   The receiver of a KEMCiphertext message MUST perform the
   Decapsulation() operation by using the sent ciphertext and the
   private key(s) of the public key(s) advertised on the end-entity
   certificate sent.

6.  Key schedule

6.1.  Negotiation

   1.   Add KEMs to "supported_groups" and KEM public key to
        "key_shares".

   2.   Add "KEMTLSwithSomeKEM" to "signature_algorithms".

   3.   Alternatively, use DC draft and add it to
        "signature_algorithms_dc".

   4.   Server replies with KEM ciphertext encapsulated to KEM public
        key (or HRR).

   5.   Server replies with CA-signed KEM public-key X.509 certificate.

   6.   Alternatively, use DC draft and reply with KEM delegated
        credential.

   7.   Server MUST NOT submit "CertificateVerify" message.

   8.   Client detects that KEMTLS is being used via the "signature
        algorithm", ie. the type of credential provided by the server.

   9.   Client encapsulates ciphertext to server and transmits it as
        "ClientKEMCiphertext" (or piggy-back on "ClientKeyExchange"?).

   10.  Client submits "ClientFinished".

   11.  Client completed handshake.

   12.  Server submits "ServerFinished".

   13.  Server completes handshake.

   TODO probably split off DC into separate paragraph.

6.2.  Handshake Secret

   The Handshake secret "HS" is derived from the ephemeral key exchange
   shared secret.

   ...
                        v
   ephemeral_kem_shared -> HKDF-Extract = Handshake Secret
                        v
   ...

6.3.  Authenticated Handshake Secret

   After deriving "HS", the Handshake Secret, from the ephemeral keys,
   we need an additional handshake secret in KEMTLS.  We require this
   additional handshake secret as we need an (implicitly) authenticated
   handshake secret to encrypt any client credentials under.  Otherwise
   we do not have confidentiality for the client certificate.

   "AHS" is derived from the hanshake secret and the static shared key.
   We change the derivation of the main secret accordingly.

                  Handshake Secret
                     |
                     v
                    Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
                     |
                     v
static_server_shared -> HKDF.Extract = Authenticated Handshake Secret
                     |
                     +-----> Derive-Secret(., "c ahs traffic",
                     |                     ClientHello...ClientKemCiphertext)
                     |                     = client_authenticated_handshake_traffic_secret
                     |
                     +-----> Derive-Secret(., "s ahs traffic",
                     |                     ClientHello...ClientKemCiphertext)
                     |                     = server_authenticated_handshake_traffic_secret
                     |
                     v
                    Derive-Secret(., "derived", "")
                     |
                     v
static_client_shared -> HKDF.Extract = Main Secret
                     v

   "shared_secret_static_client_kem" is the shared secret encapsulated
   to the client's public key.  If there is no client authentication,
   it's simply replaced by "0".

                        v
                      0 -> HKDF.Extract = Main Secret
                        v

6.4.  Finished keys

   We derived the finished keys from "MS" instead of from "CHTS" and
   "SHTS".  We separate them by individual labels and the transcript.

   finished_client <- HKDF.Expand(MS, "c finished", transcript_up_to_CF)
   finished_server <- HKDF.Expand(MS, "s finished", transcript_up_to_SF)

7.  Protocol Mechanics

   TODO

8.  (Middlebox) Compatibility Considerations

   Like in TLS 1.3, after the ephemeral key is derived a
   "ChangeCipherSpec" message is sent and the messages afterwards are
   encrypted.  This will make the following messages opaque to non-
   decrypting middle boxes.

   The "ClientHello" and "ServerHello" messages are still in the clear
   and these require the addition of new "key_share" types.  Typical KEM
   public-key and ciphertext sizes are also significantly bigger than
   pre-quantum (EC)DH keyshares.  This may still cause problems.

9.  Integration with Delegated Credentials

10.  Security Considerations

   TODO:

   *  sending data to an implicitly authenticated and not-full downgrade
      resilient peer

   *  address CA and pq keys

   *  consider implicit vs explicit authentication

   *  consider downgrade resilience

11.  IANA Considerations

   *  We need a new OID for each KEM to encode them in X.509
      certificates.
